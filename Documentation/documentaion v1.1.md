## 2. Project Vision

Project Kaleidoscope envisions a humanoid-based system as a cognitive partner that stimulates divergent thinking and challenges assumptions in team ideation processes. Inspired by cognitive diversity research, AI-assisted ideation, and generative creativity augmentation, the system acts as a "cognitive mirror and challenger." It institutionalizes creative friction, enabling teams to discover novel directions for innovation without providing direct answers—instead, it provokes reframing, combinations, and multi-perspective exploration.

### 2.1 Key Objectives
- **Ensure Diversity of Thought**: Measure and enhance idea fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration to avoid groupthink.
- **Prevent Stagnation**: Use AI to introduce unexpected stimuli, reverse problems, and expand concepts systematically.
- **Augment Human Creativity**: Serve as a persistent partner in workshops, product development, or problem-solving sessions, blending technology with human insight.
- **Promote Collaboration**: Facilitate real-time team interactions, bias balancing, and perspective integration.

### 2.2 Inputs, Outputs, and Success Criteria
- **Inputs**: Short idea descriptions, prompts, team metadata (e.g., roles, backgrounds), optional artifacts (images, sketches).
- **Outputs**: Reframed questions, domain pairings, idea variants, diversity scores, mind maps, SWOT probes, visual/text syntheses.
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Increased scores on the Idea Diversity Meter (fluency: number of ideas; flexibility: category variety; originality: uniqueness; elaboration: detail depth).
  - Richer cross-domain links in mind maps.
  - Measurable team-generated novel directions (e.g., via pre/post-session surveys).

The system aligns with emerging trends in AI for creativity, drawing from frameworks like Directed Diversity models and tools such as Seenapse for perspective reframing.

     {
       "method_used": "Random Word Association",
       "generated_ideas": [
         "Create multi-layered content that reveals more value as users dig deeper",
         "Implement rhythmic notifications that come in gentle waves rather than constant pings",
         "Design features that evolve and grow with user proficiency"
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **Techniques**: Random Word Association (primary), Reverse Brainstorming, Lotus Blossom (see Section 5).

## 5. Supported Creativity Techniques

The API integrates three established techniques for idea variation, randomly selected per request. Each is context-aware (e.g., app-specific vs. general problems) and produces actionable outputs.

### 5.1 Random Word Association
- **Overview**: Introduces unrelated stimuli to force novel connections (popularized by Edward de Bono).
- **Steps**:
  1. Define the problem.
  2. Generate random word (from pool like "ocean", "mountain").
  3. List associations/principles (e.g., "ocean" → depth, waves).
  4. Force connections (e.g., "depth" → multi-layered content).
  5. Refine ideas.
- **Example**: Input "Improve user engagement"; Word "ocean"; Ideas: "Create content that reveals deeper value."
- **Implementation**: Extensive database; templates for connections.
- **Session Tips**: 20-40 minutes; use for breaking blocks.

### 5.2 Reverse Brainstorming
- **Overview**: Flips problems to negative scenarios, then reverses to positives.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define/reverse problem (e.g., "Increase engagement" → "Make users lose interest").
  2. Brainstorm negatives (e.g., "Ignore feedback").
  3. Analyze/flip (e.g., "Respond in 24 hours").
  4. Evaluate.
- **Example**: Negatives uncover vulnerabilities; positives yield preventive solutions.
- **Implementation**: Context-aware for failure modes.
- **Session Tips**: 30-50 minutes; use worksheet for tracking.

### 5.3 Lotus Blossom Technique
- **Overview**: Systematic expansion from core ideas (developed by Yasuo Matsumura).
- **Steps**:
  1. Define central theme.
  2. Identify 8 core directions (B1-B8).
  3. Create satellite grids.
  4. Expand each to 8 sub-ideas (up to 64 tactics).
- **Example**: Core "Increase Loyalty" → B1 "Loyalty Program" → Tactics like tiered rewards.
- **Implementation**: Structured paths for comprehensive coverage.
- **Session Tips**: 60-90 minutes; use 3x3 grids.

## 6. Team Task Division

For hackathon development, tasks are split between two backend roles:

### 6.1 Backend Person 1: Core AI Logic
- Setup basic Flask and `/submit_idea`.
- Integrate NLP embeddings.
- Implement creativity techniques and `/generate_idea_variations`.

### 6.2 Backend Person 2: Collaboration Logic
- Setup Flask, SQLite, SocketIO.
- Create database schema (e.g., ideas table).
- Build team endpoints and real-time broadcasts.

**Rationale**: Parallel work with clear API contracts; modular for integration.
