# Reverse Brainstorming

> Reverse brainstorming is a powerful creative problem-solving technique that flips traditional brainstorming: instead of asking "How can we solve this problem?" you ask "How could we cause this problem?" or "How could we achieve the opposite of our goal?" This README explains the process, why it works, and how to run a session.

## Quick summary

- Goal: Use negative thinking to surface root causes, failure modes, and unconventional insights, then reverse them into constructive solutions.
- Best for: teams facing mental blocks, complex product or process problems, or when you need fresh, preventive ideas.

## The process (step-by-step)

1. Define the problem
   - State the original problem or desired goal clearly and briefly.

2. Reverse the problem
   - Flip the challenge into its negative opposite.
   - Example: Original — "How can we increase customer engagement?" Reversed — "How can we make sure customers lose interest and leave?"

3. Brainstorm negative ideas
   - Generate as many ways as possible to cause or worsen the problem. Encourage wild and silly answers.
   - Example negative ideas: "Use confusing language," "Never respond to feedback," "Remove all useful features."

4. Analyze and flip
   - Look for underlying causes and themes in the negative ideas.
   - Convert each negative idea into a positive, actionable solution.
   - Example: Negative — "Never respond to feedback." Positive — "Implement a system to respond to all customer feedback within 24 hours."

5. Evaluate and implement
   - Prioritize the flipped solutions, run quick experiments, and implement the most promising.

## Example (customer engagement)

- Original problem: "How can we increase customer engagement?"
- Reversed: "How can we make sure our customers lose interest and leave?"
- Negative ideas: Use confusing language; hide help resources; ignore feedback; make onboarding long and painful.
- Flipped solutions: Use clear, plain-language copy; add visible help and tooltips; respond to feedback within 24 hours; simplify onboarding into 3 quick steps.

## Why it works

- Breaks mental blocks: Removing the need to propose 'good' ideas frees people to think more broadly.
- Uncovers root causes: Thinking about how to cause a problem exposes vulnerabilities and hidden assumptions.
- Encourages creativity: Absurd or exaggerated negative ideas often point to novel, practical solutions once reversed.
- Focuses on prevention: Highlights failure modes to proactively defend against them.

## When to use it

- Stalled teams with few new ideas
- Complex systems with hidden failure modes
- Retrospectives and risk-assessment workshops
- Early product planning to spot pitfalls early

## Facilitation tips

- Timebox each phase (e.g., 5–10 minutes to brainstorm negatives, 10–20 to flip and evaluate).
- Encourage every idea (no criticism during the negative brainstorming phase).
- Capture themes — group similar negative ideas before flipping them.
- Use anonymous submission (sticky notes or a shared doc) to get more candor.

## Simple session template (30–50 minutes)

1. 5 min — Frame the problem and rules
2. 10–15 min — Reverse the problem and brainstorm negative ideas
3. 10–15 min — Group and analyze negatives; identify patterns
4. 10–15 min — Flip ideas to positive solutions, prioritize
5. 5 min — Decide next actions and owners

## Quick worksheet (one-line columns)

| Negative idea | Root cause / insight | Flipped solution | Owner | Priority |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|
| Never respond to feedback | No feedback loop | Respond within 24 hours; automate receipts | Product | High |

## Pitfalls and how to avoid them

- Obsessing over unrealistic negatives: keep focus on root causes that are relevant.
- Skipping the flip: the value is in converting negatives into concrete, testable positives.
- Groupthink: rotate facilitators and use anonymous input to diversify thinking.

## Further reading & references

- Use standard brainstorming and design-thinking literature to complement this technique. Reverse brainstorming is often used together with root-cause analysis and failure-mode-and-effects-analysis (FMEA).

## Notes and variations

- Variations: reverse-assumption mapping (flip key assumptions) and negative persona development (create 'anti-user' behaviors to expose weaknesses).
- This method works both in-person (sticky notes) and remotely (shared documents, Miro, MURAL).
